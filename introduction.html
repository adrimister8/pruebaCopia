          <p>
            I bought my first PC in June 1998 and compiled my first program -
            written in <i>Delphi 1</i> - in January 1999: since then, I have studied
            and employed a wide variety of technologies, both on my own and for work.
          </p>

          <p>
            Over the years, I have created software mainly in
            <b>Object-Oriented Programming</b>
            (<i>Java</i>, <i>Delphi</i>, <i>C#</i>, <i>Python</i>, ...), especially in
            the context of <i>Domain-Driven Design</i> and,
            since 2015, I have been passionately focusing on
            <strong>Functional Programming</strong> (in particular <i>Erlang</i>,
            <i>Elm</i> and <i>Haskell</i>), as I believe it revises and extends
            the best ideas of other methodologies, leading to
            <em>more effective design and development</em>, with fewer bugs
            and cleaner code: an example is
            <a href="{{ site.data.links.eighthbridge }}">EighthBridge</a>, my
            hybrid OOP-FP library dedicated to <i>graph modeling</i> and <i>interactive
              rendering</i> - which is the Elm-inspired evolution of <i>Arcontes</i>,
              another library that I published years ago.
          </p>

          <p>
            Currently, my favorite language is <strong>Scala</strong>, as it
            enables <em>a smooth transition</em> to the concepts of Functional
            Programming while <em>supporting previous investments</em> in OOP and in
            the Java ecosystem.
          </p>


          <p>
            <b>Build tools</b> are another domain I am keen on - especially
            <b>Gradle</b>, although I employed Maven and Ant as well,
            also writing plugins which you can still find among my
            <a href="{{ site.data.links.github }}">GitHub projects</a>.
            My plugin for Gradle is
            <a href="{{ site.data.links.aurora }}">Aurora</a>, designed to be
            the core of every modern open source application or library I have released for
            the JVM (Scala, Java, Groovy), greatly simplifying software distribution;
            you are also invited to visit
            <a href="{{ site.data.links.hephaestus }}">Hephaestus</a>,
            my Gradle/Maven repository.

        <div class="panel-body">
          <p>
            <i>Human languages</i> are even more important than software languages - as
            they convey a much broader stream of ideas - and I am definitely
            passionate about several aspects of linguistics - <i>morphology</i>,
            <i>syntax</i>, <i>phonetics</i>...
          </p>

          <p>
            My native language is <b>Italian</b>, and I studied <b>English</b> and
            <b>French</b> at high school,
            later reaching <strong>certified C1</strong> level in both.
          </p>

          <p>
            In 2015 I discovered <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/">Duolingo</a>, a brilliant
            didactic app, and I decided to begin learning my 4th language - <b>Dutch</b>:
            the result was definitely positive, and I enjoyed the new language to the point that,
            after a few months, I also started <b>German</b>, which has quickly become
            one of my favorite languages.

          <p>
            <strong>My first award</strong> dates back to 2003: I was among the winners of a competition,
            held by <a href="http://www.accademia-rubiconia-filop.org/">Rubiconia Accademia dei Filopatridi</a>,
            consisting in the translation of a speech composed by the <b>Latin orator Cicero</b>.
          </p>

          <p>
            I attended a scientific high school - Liceo Scientifico "Enrico Fermi" - and
            received my diploma in 2005, with <strong>a score of 100/100</strong>.
          </p>

          <p>
            After <strong>graduating with honours in Computer Engineering</strong> at the
            University of Bologna in 2009, I spent about <b>4 years</b> in
            the IT industry, working on a few different activities:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Software development</b> on a variety of technologies, mainly in the
              <b>C#</b> and <b>Java</b> ecosystems - including <em>Silverlight</em>,
               <em>ASP.NET MVC</em> and <em>Struts</em>
            </li>

            <li>
              <b>Teaching</b> to junior developers - especially <i>C#</i> and
              OOP good practices, as well as <i>brown-bag sessions</i> to colleagues
              (for example, on
              <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/giancosta86/py-intro-32961375">Python</a>
              and

            </li>

            <li>
              <b>Database querying and scripting</b> -
              in <em>Oracle 10g</em>, <em>SQL Server</em> and <em>MongoDB</em>
            </li>

            <li>
              <b>Build tools</b>: I introduced <em>Maven</em> and <em>Hudson</em> in one
              of the companies I worked for, so as to vastly enhance and simplify
              the management of Java artifacts
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>

          </p>

          <p>
            In the meantime, I continued studying on my own in several fields - <b>web technologies</b> and <b>OOP languages</b> - in
            addition to creating open source software: in January 2014,
            <a href="https://dzone.com/articles/nb-easypmd4-1">Geertjan Wielenga interviewed me on EasyPmd</a>, my plugin for NetBeans.
          </p>

          <p>
            In 2014 I decided to return to University, in order to achieve <strong>Master's Degree</strong>
            in Computer Engineering (in December 2016) - and I am
            definitely satisfied about my choice in terms of acquired skills; furthermore, I worked hard to delve into
            <b>Functional Programming</b>, releasing didactic hybrid (OOP-FP) Scala projects -
            for the most part dedicated to <b>Operations Research</b> and <b>Artificial Intelligence</b> - such as
            <a href="{{ site.data.areas.knapscal }}">KnapScal</a>,
            <a href="{{ site.data.areas.chronoside }}">Chronos</a> and
            <a href="{{ site.data.areas.graphsj }}">GraphsJ</a>.
          </p>

          <p>
            In July 2016 I was awarded the <strong>prize dedicated to the 30 most brilliant engineering students</strong> at the University of Bologna in the
            year 2015/2016.

        <div class="panel-body">
          <p>I adore music - from classical (Mozart, Chopin, Bach, ...)
            to opera (Rossini, Donizetti, Verdi, Bellini, ...), up to
            modern (Édith Piaf, Queen, Dschinghis Khan, ...) and contemporary
            music (Jörn Schlönvoigt, Lady Gaga, ...).
          </p>

          <p>
            In particular, I'm fond of modern arrangements of classical pieces,
            such as <b>David Garrett's violin masterpieces</b> and some <b>symphonic metal</b>
            (Nightwish, Dark Moor, Rhapsody, ...), as I think they brilliantly combine classical
            style with modern sound and technology.

        <div class="panel-body">
          <p>
            Aristotle used to say that Philosophy is a natural aspect of mankind -
            born from the very act of <b>wondering</b> in front of natural phenomena,
            which leads us to posing questions and finding answers.
          </p>

          <p>
            In this regard, at high school I passionately studied the ideas of many
            different philosophers - from Ancient Greece up to the
            XX century - and I believe it was a very
            formative experience in the definition of <em>a personal view of the world</em>.
          </p>

          <p>
            As time passed, of course, I have developed my own preferences,
            and I'd say that my favorite philosophical trail is <b>the Enlightenment</b> -
            because personalities such as <em>Voltaire</em>, <em>Beccaria</em>, <em>Goethe</em> and many
            others (including contemporary thinkers like <em>Popper</em> and <em>Russell</em>)
            were not only brilliant philosophers, but also intellectuals caring
            for the evolution towards <em>a more human society</em>.

        <div class="panel-body">
          <p>
            <cite>Elegance always matters</cite>... but, apart from
            the artistic, creative aspect I want to underline in the process of software development, what does it mean?
          </p>

          <p>
            Unfortunately, <i>elegance</i> is a concept really difficult to define, which should
            always be inscribed in a context; however, we can take a different approach and
            name a few misconceptions about elegance:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <blockquote>
                Elegance is <strong>not</strong> "any set of practices just slowing down software development"
              </blockquote>

              <p>
                This is perhaps the worst misconception and the most expensive one,
                easily leading to unmaintainable, buggy and frustrating blobs of <i>spaghetti code</i>.
              </p>

              <p>
                Indeed, perfection is almost impossible and projects are usually assigned a budget in terms
                of resources such as time and money - but I think it is paramount to strive for achieving
                <em>the clearest and most maintainable code structure among the feasible ones</em>.
                Well, this might actually be a good definition of <i>elegance</i> in software engineering! ^__^!
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <blockquote>
                Elegance is <strong>not</strong> necessarily <i>wearing formal or expensive garments</i>
              </blockquote>

                <p>
                  Needless to say - this aspect might contribute to overall elegance, but I believe that what
                  matters first are <em>concepts</em>, <em>principles</em>,
                  <em>skills</em> and <strong>ideas</strong>.
                </p>

        <div class="card-body">
          <p>
            I bought my first PC in June 1998 and compiled my first program -
            written in <i>Delphi 1</i> - in January 1999: since then, I have studied
            and employed a wide variety of technologies, both on my own and for work.
          </p>

          <p>
            Over the years, I have created software mainly in
            <b>Object-Oriented Programming</b>
            (<i>Java</i>, <i>Delphi</i>, <i>C#</i>, <i>Python</i>, ...), gradually learning
            the principles of <i>Domain-Driven Design</i>; however,
            since 2015, I have been passionately focusing on
            <strong>Functional Programming</strong> as well,
            as I believe it revises and extends
            the best ideas of other methodologies, leading to
            <em>more effective design and development</em>, with fewer bugs
            and cleaner code: an example is
            <a href="{{ site.data.links.eighthBridge }}">EighthBridge</a>, my
            hybrid OOP-FP library dedicated to <i>graph modeling</i> and <i>interactive
              rendering</i> - inspired by Elm.
            </p>

          <p>
            Currently, my favorite languages are <strong>Java 8</strong> and
            <strong>Scala</strong>, because they
            enable <em>a smooth transition</em> to the concepts of Functional
            Programming while <em>supporting previous investments</em> in OOP and in
            the huge Java ecosystem.
          </p>


          <p>
            <b>Build tools</b> are another domain I am keen on - especially
            <b>Gradle</b>, although I employed Maven and Ant too, creating
            custom plugins: my plugin for Gradle is
            <a href="{{ site.data.links.aurora }}">Aurora</a>, designed to be
            the core of every modern open source application or library I have released for
            the JVM (Java, Scala, Groovy), greatly simplifying software distribution;
            you are also invited to visit
            <a href="{{ site.data.links.hephaestus }}">Hephaestus</a>,
            my Gradle/Maven repository.
          </p>

          <p>
            More generally, I enjoy applying patterns and ideas to several
            sectors and different problem kinds - as <b>it fosters creativity</b>; to see
            a range of examples, please refer to my
            <a href="{{ site.data.links.gitHub }}">GitHub profile</a>.

        <div class="card-body">
          <p>
            <i>Natural languages</i> are even more important than software languages - as
            they convey a much broader stream of ideas - and I am definitely
            passionate about several aspects of linguistics - <i>morphology</i>,
            <i>syntax</i>, <i>phonetics</i>...
          </p>

          <p>
            My native language is <b>Italian</b>, and I studied <b>English</b> and
            <b>French</b> at high school,
            later reaching <strong>certified C1</strong> level in both.
          </p>

          <p>
            In 2015 I decided to begin learning my 4th language - <b>Dutch</b> - and
            the result was quite positive. Therefore, in July 2016,
            I also started <b>German</b>, getting <i>Goethe Zertifikat B1</i>
            about 10 months later, in June 2017.
          </p>

          <p>
            In 2017 I have created a website named
            <a href="{{ site.data.links.farbigesDeutsch }}">Farbiges Deutsch</a>,
            describing German grammar via both theoretical rules and statistical rules
            inferred by performing Data Mining on a German linguistic corpus; learning
            from that experience, in 2018 I have started
            <a href="http://gianlucacosta.info/Marianne">Marianne</a>, a website
            dedicated to French language and culture.
          </p>

          <p>
            From time to time I like approaching new languages!
            For example, I studied a bit of <b>Spanish</b> - and I am currently
            learning a bit of <b>Chinese</b>! ^__^

            In 2003 I was among the winners of a competition,
            held by <b>Rubiconia Accademia dei Filopatridi</b>,
            consisting in the translation of a speech composed by the Latin orator Cicero.
          </p>

          <p>
            I attended a scientific high school - Liceo Scientifico "Enrico Fermi" - and
            received my diploma in 2005, with <strong>a score of 100/100</strong>.
          </p>

          <p>
            After <strong>graduating with honours in Computer Engineering</strong> at the
            University of Bologna in 2009, I spent more than <b>4 years</b> in
            the IT industry, working on a few different activities:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Software development</b> on a variety of technologies, mainly in the
              <b>C#</b> and <b>Java</b> ecosystems - including <em>Silverlight</em>,
               <em>ASP.NET MVC</em> and <em>Struts</em>
            </li>

            <li>
              <b>Teaching</b> to junior developers - especially <i>C#</i> and
              OOP good practices, as well as <i>brown-bag sessions</i> to colleagues
              (for example, on
              <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/giancosta86/introduction-to-python">Python</a>
              and
              <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/giancosta86/introduction-to-regular-expressions">Regular expressions</a>)
            </li>

            <li>
              <b>Database querying and scripting</b> -
              in <em>Oracle 10g</em>, <em>SQL Server</em> and <em>MongoDB</em>
            </li>

            <li>
              <b>Build tools</b>: I introduced <em>Maven</em> and <em>Hudson</em> in one
              of the companies I worked for, so as to vastly enhance and simplify
              the management of Java artifacts
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            For details on my work experience, please consult my
            <a href="{{ site.data.links.xing }}">XING</a> or

            <a href="{{ site.data.links.timeline}}">my timeline</a> sums up my technical experience.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the meantime, I continued studying on my own in several fields - <b>web technologies</b> and <b>OOP languages</b> - in
            addition to creating open source software: in January 2014,
            <a href="https://dzone.com/articles/nb-easypmd4-1">Geertjan Wielenga interviewed me on EasyPmd</a>, my plugin for NetBeans.
          </p>

          <p>
            In 2014 I decided to return to University, in order to achieve <strong>Master's Degree</strong>
            in Computer Engineering (in December 2016) - and I am
            definitely satisfied about my choice in terms of acquired skills; furthermore, I worked hard to delve into
            <b>Functional Programming</b>, releasing didactic hybrid (OOP-FP) Scala projects -
            for the most part dedicated to <b>Operations Research</b> and <b>Artificial Intelligence</b> - such as
            <a href="{{ site.data.links.knapScal }}">KnapScal</a>,
            <a href="{{ site.data.links.chronos }}">Chronos</a> and
            <a href="{{ site.data.links.graphsJ }}">GraphsJ</a>.
          </p>

          <p>
            In July 2016 I was awarded the <strong>prize dedicated to the 30 most brilliant engineering students</strong> at the University of Bologna
            during the previous year and in December 2016 I achieved -  <em>with honours</em> - <strong>Master's Degree</strong>.

        </div>
        <div class="card-body">
          <p>I adore music - from classical (Mozart, Chopin, Bach, ...)
            to opera (Rossini, Donizetti, Verdi, Bellini, ...), up to
            modern (Édith Piaf, Queen, Dschinghis Khan, ...) and contemporary
            music (Jörn Schlönvoigt, ...).
          </p>

          <p>
            In particular, I'm fond of modern arrangements of classical pieces,
            such as <b>David Garrett's violin masterpieces</b> and some <b>symphonic metal</b>,
            as I think they brilliantly combine classical style with modern sound and technology.
          </p>

          <p>
            I can play the piano (although not fluently) and, since mid-2017, I've studied a bit more of
            Music and harmony theory.

        <div class="card-body">
          <p>
            Aristotle used to say that Philosophy is a natural aspect of mankind -
            born from the very act of <b>wondering</b> in front of natural phenomena,
            which leads us to posing questions and finding answers.
          </p>

          <p>
            In this regard, at high school I passionately studied the ideas of many
            different philosophers - from Ancient Greece up to the
            XX century - and I believe it was a very
            formative experience in the definition of <em>a personal view of the world</em>.
          </p>

          <p>
            As time passed, of course, I have developed my own preferences,
            and I'd say that my favorite philosophical trail is <b>the Enlightenment</b> -
            because personalities such as <em>Voltaire</em>, <em>Beccaria</em>, <em>Goethe</em> and many
            others (including contemporary thinkers like <em>Popper</em> and <em>Russell</em>)
            were not only brilliant philosophers, but also intellectuals caring
            for the evolution towards <em>a more human society</em>.

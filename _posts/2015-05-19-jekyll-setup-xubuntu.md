title: Installing Jekyll on Xubuntu
---

[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) is a brilliant tool for static website creation, and installing its latest version on my Xubuntu 15 machine was definitely easy:

1. Open a root shell by running:

	> sudo -i

	and typing your password

2. Execute: 

	> apt-get install ruby ruby-dev nodejs

	and confirm

3. Run: 

	> gem install jekyll

4. Exit the root shell


And that's all! ^\_\_^! Jekyll is now ready!

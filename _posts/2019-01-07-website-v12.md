title: The 12th version of my website is online!

Almost 10 years have passed since the very first version of this website - which had just a couple basic CSS rules and not even a custom domain.

Over the years, it was a pleasure to delve into the world of **web development**; the main themes of this brand-new release are:

* **responsive design**, to provide more *customized experience* on a wide range of devices

* massive adoption of **Bootstrap 4** to enhance GUI development

* **expandable Bootstrap cards** to directly provide *core information*, with details on demand

* **Bootstrap carousel** showing screenshots, description and references of my *featured projects*

* improved use of **Liquid** templating constructs - especially *parameterized includes* and *data files* provided by **Jekyll**, to further minimize boilerplate markup

* **jQuery** hook on document loading via modern **ES 6** syntax

* **enhanced CSS 3** - such as more *box shadows* and *text shadows*

Last but not least, I have deleted my **SlideShare account**: please, update your references to my [SpeakerDeck](https://speakerdeck.com/giancosta86) account.

I hope you'll enjoy this new version of my website! ^\_\_^

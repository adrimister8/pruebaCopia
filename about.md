## About me

Welcome! ^\_\_^

I am a software architect and developer, fond of technology, linguistics, music and philosophy; *software architecture* and *Domain-Driven Design* are currently my favourite areas of study and work in the IT sector, especially when related to Java or C#, but I'm also experimenting with *functional programming* - primarily in Scala and Groovy.

Considering that software should be not only useful but also *elegant* and *robust*, I value production improvements via *well-crafted architectures*, *refactoring* and *agile methodologies*.

After graduating with honours in Computer Engineering from the University of Bologna, I worked for about 5 years in the IT industry, proactively focusing on innovation; now, I'm studying to achieve the subsequent Master's degree, always maintaining a practical approach by dedicating time to a wide range of open source projects.

I often mention *elegance*, because I believe it's a paramount concept in software creation: I think that information technology, apart from its scientific aspects, is also *an art* demanding *passion* and *attention to the detail* - which is why I am keen on the motto *Code is poetry*.

Consequently, I strongly prefer *people-oriented* workplaces, fostering *communication*, *creativity* and *research* - without sacrificing conceptual rigour - in lieu of rigid schematisms.

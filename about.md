## About me

Welcome! ^\_\_^

I am a software architect and developer, fond of *technology*, *linguistics*, *music* and *philosophy*.

After building up a strong background in **OOP** (Java, C#, Python, Delphi, ...) over the years, I am now extremely interested in **functional programming**, trying to borrow ideas and techniques from both worlds - which is why I'm definitely fond of **Scala**, a language that allows to elegantly and flexibly *blend* them; I'm also learning **Haskell** and **Elm** to have a broader vision on functional programming - and I really enjoy them as well.

Considering that software should be not only *useful* but also *elegant* and *robust*, I value production improvements via *well-crafted architectures*, *refactoring* and *agile methodologies*. Modern *build systems* - especially **Gradle** and *Maven* - are, in my opinion, essential for software development and maintenance.

After graduating with honours in Computer Engineering from the University of Bologna, I worked for about 5 years in the IT industry, proactively focusing on innovation; now, I'm studying to achieve the subsequent Master's degree, always maintaining a practical approach by dedicating time to a wide range of open source projects.

I often mention **elegance**, in terms of *care* and *craftsmanship*, because I believe it's a paramount concept in software creation: I think that information technology, apart from its scientific aspects, is also *an art* demanding *passion* and *attention to the detail* - which is why I am keen on the motto *Code is poetry*.

Consequently, I strongly prefer *people-oriented* workplaces, fostering *communication*, *creativity* and *research* - without sacrificing conceptual rigour - in lieu of rigid schematism.

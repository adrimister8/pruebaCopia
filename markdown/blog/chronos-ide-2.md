[Chronos](https://github.com/giancosta86/Chronos), my didactic programming language dedicated to _Discrete Event Simulation_ (DES), has now reached version 2; it has definitely been a _valuable_ and _formative_ experience, as it is based on my very first _context-free grammar_.

Furthermore, while working on the project I have studied [Scala](http://scala-lang.org/) in depth, as I was attracted by its _elegance_ and _flexibility_ - and I have appreciated it to the point that I have rewritten [Chronos IDE](https://github.com/giancosta86/Chronos-IDE) - a JavaFX enhanced editor for Chronos - entirely in Scala and [ScalaFX](http://www.scalafx.org/)! ^\_\_^

Chronos borrows ideas and constructs from SIMSCRIPT, Python, Scala and JavaScript, and it's especially suitable for students of Operations Research, as well as for anyone needing to _quickly prototype_ a simulation in a didactic context.

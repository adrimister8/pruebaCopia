Almost 10 years have passed since the very first version of this website - which had just a couple basic CSS rules and not even a custom domain.

Over the years, it was a pleasure to delve into the world of **web development**; the main themes of this brand-new release are:

- **responsive design**, to provide more _customized experience_ on a wide range of devices

- massive adoption of **Bootstrap 4** to enhance GUI development

- **expandable Bootstrap cards** to directly provide _core information_, with details on demand

- **Bootstrap carousel** showing screenshots, description and references of my _featured projects_

- improved use of **Liquid** templating constructs - especially _parameterized includes_ and _data files_ provided by **Jekyll**, to further minimize boilerplate markup

- **jQuery** hook on document loading via modern **ES 6** syntax

- **enhanced CSS 3** - such as more _box shadows_ and _text shadows_

Last but not least, I have deleted my **SlideShare account**: please, update your references to my [SpeakerDeck](https://speakerdeck.com/giancosta86) account.

I hope you'll enjoy this new version of my website! ^\_\_^

I'm glad to announce the new release of my website, now using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)!

The former layout was fairly old - I designed its core in late 2010 - so I definitely needed a lighter, more modern UI...

A few weeks ago, I stumbled upon the brilliant [Emerald](http://www.jacoporabolini.com/emerald) theme, by [Jacopo Rabolini](http://www.jacoporabolini.com/), and I was definitely impressed by its simplicity and elegance - which is why I have chosen to employ it as the base for this new version!

The whole _Software_ area has now moved to [my GitHub account](https://github.com/giancosta86), making the source code easily accessible.

Another important piece of news is that Hephaestus, my Maven repository now mainly built with [Gradle](http://gradle.org/), has moved to [Bintray](https://bintray.com/)!

Therefore, Hephaestus's new official URL is: [https://bintray.com/giancosta86/Hephaestus](https://bintray.com/giancosta86/Hephaestus); its artifacts can be downloaded using Gradle, Maven or other compatible technologies.

Last but not least, the _News_ area has been superseded by [my Twitter account](https://twitter.com/giancosta86): you are all invited to follow it! ^\_\_^

More than 7 years have passed since the day I decided to create my own website - which I published a few months later, in September 2009.

Over the years, my website has gradually evolved:

- **v1.0** was a basic set of pages employing rudimentary CSS styling

- **v2.0** employed more advanced CSS techniques, as I had studied Eric Meyer's book in the meantime

- **v3.0** included a custom PHP-based administration console I wrote to play with server-side scripting

- **v4.0** and **v5.0** replaced PHP with Python, for simplicity and elegance; they also added support for mobile devices

- **v6.0** introduced a dedicated deployment system written in Python

- **v7.0** was the first version published on GitHub pages, built with Jekyll

- **v8.0** and **v9.0** were variations on the theme introduced in v7.0

And now comes the 10th version of the website! It features:

- A brand-new layout, based on [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)

- [Tags]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ site.data.links.blogTagsPath }}), to keep the posts organized and easy to reach

- A [redesigned CV]({{ site.baseurl }}/cv_costa_en.pdf)

- Custom [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) project structure

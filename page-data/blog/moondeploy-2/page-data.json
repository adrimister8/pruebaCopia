And so I created MoonDeploy.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/giancosta86/moondeploy\">MoonDeploy</a> is an open source tool designed to address the above issues:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>it is configured via <em>a simple JSON file</em>, which describes the archives containing the files for your application - which can be created using <em>any technology</em>. It also states how to run the app in the different operating systems</li>\n<li>There is no need to <em>compile</em> the app descriptor: just write it with a text editor (or create it with an automated build tool) and deploy it with your packages - for example a single zip file created by Gradle's <em>application</em> plugin</li>\n<li>it is <em>optimized for GitHub</em>: when requested by the app descriptor, it can query <em>GitHub's APIs</em> to retrieve the latest version and compare it with the installed version</li>\n<li>it provides <em>granular versioning</em> - an application is versioned, but <em>its packages as well</em>! Therefore, when an application starts, only new packages are downloaded</li>\n<li>it is <em>written in Go</em>, a native but easily portable programming language. Binary downloads for MoonDeploy are available for both Linux and Windows - and it should run on Mac OS too, if built from sources</li>\n<li>it is <em>open source</em>, hosted on GitHub</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is just a brief summary of its features, but there is more! ^__^!</p>\n<p>The new major version, just released, introduces a few enhancements, in particular:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a <strong>GTK+ 3</strong> user interface, based on <strong>Glade</strong>, for better integration with modern systems and to simplify portability on Mac OS</li>\n<li>Shorter application path for GitHub projects relying on the concept of <em>latest release</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>You are all invited to visit <a href=\"https://github.com/giancosta86/moondeploy\">MoonDeploy's project page</a>, which contains an up-to-date list of its features, in-depth considerations and the syntax reference of the app descriptor format.</p>\n<h2>Further references</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/giancosta86/moondeploy\">MoonDeploy on GitHub</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/MoonDeploy\">MoonDeploy on Facebook</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/giancosta86/Chronos-IDE\">Chronos IDE</a> - the first application employing MoonDeploy</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/webstart/\">Java Web Start</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/\">GitHub</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/threerings/getdown\">Getdown</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://0install.net/\">ZeroInstall</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.gtk.org/\">GTK+</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://glade.gnome.org/\">Glade</a></li>\n</ul>"}},"pageContext":{"nodeId":"99749007-cb19-55ee-a0e9-7f0a1f76c315"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3567824559"]}

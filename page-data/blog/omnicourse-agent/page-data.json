Consequently, I had to revise my architecture a few times - in particular, to achieve <em>elegant message passing</em> between the extension components</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>vanilla ES6</strong> concepts - such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>IIFEs</strong>, especially to create modules</li>\n<li><strong>Promises</strong> - with lots of <strong>async/await</strong></li>\n<li><strong>DOM manipulation</strong> - mainly via <em>querySelector</em></li>\n<li>modern syntax</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Node APIs</strong> and <strong>packages</strong> - to create <strong>elegant</strong> and <em>flexible</em> build scripts that are also <em>OS-independent</em></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Future developments</h2>\n<p>OmniCourse-Agent is currently <em>not available on the main extension portals</em> - instead, its artifacts can be downloaded from its GitHub page.</p>\n<p>This situation introduces 2 major disadvantages:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the installation process is <em>slightly more difficult</em> - but that can be solved via the instructions within its <a href=\"https://github.com/giancosta86/OmniCourse-Agent/blob/master/README.md\">README file</a></li>\n<li>the <strong>update process</strong> is not automatic - that is, <em>new versions must be installed manually</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>However, I'm considering the idea of deploying OmniCourse-Agent to the official extension portals - so please, stay tuned! ^__^!</p>\n<h2>Further references</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/giancosta86/OmniCourse-Agent\">OmniCourse-Agent</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/giancosta86/OmniCourse\">OmniCourse</a></li>\n</ul>"}},"pageContext":{"nodeId":"a0337288-7dac-5914-b540-1a77f4c534ea"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3567824559"]}

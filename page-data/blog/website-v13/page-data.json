furthermore, I have managed to integrate the <strong>React version of Font Awesome's icons</strong>.</p>\n<p>As a cute symbol of both <em>creativity</em> and <em>inclusion</em>, I have slightly redesigned the <em>jumbotron</em> in the home page - painting a <em>rainbow gradient</em> based on ideas derived from <em>Color Theory</em>.</p>\n<h2>Elegance always matters</h2>\n<p>It was paramount to have a new, <strong>JavaScript-based stack</strong>, widely relying on <em>React</em>, so as to to enter the world of flexibility provided by <strong>ES6</strong> and key solutions like <strong>NPM</strong>.</p>\n<p>To streamline the deployment, <em>CI/CD integration</em> with <strong>Travis CI</strong>, recently explored with <a href=\"https://gianlucacosta.info/Arcadia\">Arcadia</a>, is another asset of this edition.</p>\n<p>Last but not least, while creating <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@giancosta86/omnicourse\">OmniCourse</a>, I have explored in detail how <strong>transpilation</strong> and <strong>polyfills</strong> work, especially via <strong>Babel</strong>: I have applied it to Gatsby itself, in order to write ES6 modules all over the project, but future versions of the website might be able to widely employ this interesting technology to <em>foster browser compatibility</em>.</p>"}},"pageContext":{"nodeId":"87d61f1e-7031-5df6-89ef-a74085ebab86"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","3567824559"]}
